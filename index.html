        My name is Debbie and I am a senior at Hunter College. I am Greek and Spanish. Growing up Greek, I was surrounded by storytelling that made stories feel 
        this is how we connect. Telling stories is my passion and, as a media major, sports reporting allows me to do that. Covering sporting events is not only 
        exciting but also enables me to observe, assess, and deliver the game with objectivity and focus. I have been a sports fan for a long time and was drawn 
        to the games: the intensity of the competition, the players’ personal stories, the players that I adore, and the culture that sports bring. I grew curious 
        about sports journalism as I realized it is more than just about numbers and events in a field. Sports journalism to me is capturing the stories and 
        excitement behind the games- it is the human experience and emotions that intrigue me. This is what made me really interested in sports journalism - 
        the opportunity to weave and tell the stories off the court, and to merge my creative side with something I care about. Writing/journalism inspires me 
        to create art/media through it. Through journalism, I am able to convey what interests me and lean towards it. My goal is to write in a way that connects 
        readers more closely to the game that they enjoy and the players who make it what it is. Above all, I want my writing to bring fans closer to the game 
        that they love, bring on new fans and the celebrate the people who make it meaningful.
