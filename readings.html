      <h2>With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster</h2>
      <p><em>Date:</em> February 16, 2026</p>

      <p>
        In the article for Nesrine Malik expressed concern over what she described as an onslaught of AI slop dominating internet content. She defined AI slop as AI-generated imagery, video and text which is shallow, addictive and ludicrously cheap. Malik said this slop creates noise that is entertainment that aims to inflame people rather than inform them, which confuses our understanding of reality and what is fake.
      </p>
      <p>
      The core of Malik’s argument resonates deeply. AI slop isn’t simply “junk content”; its content engineered for the attention economy. Social media platforms reward engagement — clicks, likes, comments — and the easiest way to generate that engagement at scale is with repetitive, sensational, emotionally charged material, rather than thoughtful or accurate information. Troubling is that the AI generated pieces seem so real. If something looks legitimate, even savvy users may believe it's real if they don't look close enough.  
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most compelling points in the article is how AI slop doesn’t just clutter our feeds; it shapes perception in a way that can shift political or cultural narratives. Malik describes examples where AI-generated political imagery and fabricated scenarios are circulated so widely that they reinforce certain ideologies or biases, intentionally or not. In such cases, AI becomes a tool not for augmenting understanding but for manufacturing convenient realities that align with someone’s preexisting views or agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find this deeply concerning because it suggests that we are entering a new phase in the struggle over information integrity. In previous eras, misinformation was often limited by how quickly and cheaply it could be produced. AI removes those barriers. Now anyone can generate visually convincing material in seconds — and a fraction of it is indistinguishable from actual human-produced content. The content isn’t just low quality; it’s ubiquitous, adaptive and unaccountable in ways traditional misinformation never was.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Equally compelling, though, is Malik’s insistence that AI slop doesn’t just fool us. It also captures our attention and drains us of emotional reserves that would allow us to properly engage with the world around us — especially things that require more thought or nuance than AI slop does. When were aren’t being lied to, we’re being managed. Every emoji reaction, clickbait outrage link, and endless scroll renders us less able to care about, or even properly process in real-time, actual things that happen in the world, even when they’re terrible.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is such an incredible opportunity to use AI to help everyone be creators. To help make life better for all of us. But if we’re not careful, it will destroy the pillars our society has used to define truth. AI slop makes me think we should all be better consumers of online media. Demand better from platforms. Content quality is as important as content quantity. As a college student, this matters to me because so much of my learning depends on credible sources. If my feeds and search results are flooded with “AI slop,” it gets harder to tell what’s real, cite responsibly, and build original ideas instead of absorbing recycled misinformation.

    <h2>A Reflection on Cave by Plato: In Plato's Cave</h2>
     <p><em>Date:</em> February 9, 2026</p>
    <p>
      Plato’s Cave by Susan Sontag is an essay that describes the manner in which photographs influence the perception of the world by people. Her reasoning is disconcerting and blunt. Photographs are a guarantee of the truth, and at the same time, they capture the audience in an image cave. This reflection will consider how her thoughts affect the knowledge, memory and everyday life in a picture-saturated culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sontag asserts that when one photographs something, then it is to steal it, to seize it in a sort of ownership. Photographs make people feel that they are aware of the events, locations, and strangers that are far away. But what knowledge is superficial. One picture will not describe history, causes, and motives. It provides a thin slice of time, space, bounded by the choice of another person. The spectator can also feel informed just because the camera was directed towards something different. This manner will enable the viewers to feel strong and knowledgeable, although they remain passive and aloof to taking real action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photography is also connected to power and even aggression, as the essay also links it. This is the camera pointing, shooting, and capturing an image. It turns the subject into an object that can be gathered, pinned up to a wall, or put up in an album. Sontag even refers to photography as a sublimated murder since it captures a moment and creates images of people who are alive. This statement is cruel, yet it draws out the ethical dilemma in viewing the pain, shock, or shame of other people without getting involved to assist them. The photographer documents; another person is victimized.
    </p>
    <p>
    The connection between the photographs and tourism, as well as between the photographs and family life, is another impressive thought of the essay. The cameras follow families to marriages, holidays, and campuses. To the tourist, picture-taking tends to substitute real life. Rather than taking the time to touch something to feel it, most individuals run in a bid to take a picture of it and move on.   
    </p>
    <p>
      Another concern raised by Sontag is that moral feeling may be numbed by constant exposure to the images of war, hunger, and disaster. Photographs of horror can be shocking and disturbing at first. With time, as instances of similar images increase, the shock subsides. People are accustomed to bodies, ruins, and sorrows. The image turns into nothing more than a photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the latter part of the essay, Sontag proposes that photographs can never provide a fundamental comprehension. They may get conscience off their knees a little, or stuff desire and curiosity, but they do not know how things work in the long run. Actual knowledge requires narratives, reasons, and definite correlations among events. Photography, in its turn, divides the world into a significant number of individual moments. All of them welcome emotion and imagination, rather than full-fledged thinking. That is why the image world is able not only to bring reality near and accessible but also to transform it into an object of a remote exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The essay portrays photography as a blessing and a threat. It opens up places and people that otherwise would remain hidden. Simultaneously, it may reduce life to a life of images to gather but not experiences to experience and comprehend. Sontag does not have a cave that is far away. It resembles the contemporary world, in which practically everything is there because it has to appear in a photograph.
